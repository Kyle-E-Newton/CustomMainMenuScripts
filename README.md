This is the scripts for my custom main menu for r5reloaded

I recommend a fresh scripts install before installing this.


Quick install guide

move the platform folder into your main folder and replace.

move r5detours.dll and r5dev.dll over into your main apex folder and replace.

move the frontend.bik file into your apex media folder and replace. (%apexfolder%/media/)
